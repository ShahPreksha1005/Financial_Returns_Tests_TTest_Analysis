# Financial Returns Comparison using T-Tests

   This repository presents an in-depth analysis of synthetic financial data using independent and paired t-tests to assess differences in mean returns across distinct customer groups. The analysis investigates whether observed variations in sample means are statistically significant, offering insights into financial performance disparities among groups.

   ## Project Overview

   **Aim**  
  The objective of this project is to test whether significant differences exist in the mean returns between customer groups by applying independent two-sample t-tests (for equal and unequal variances) and paired t-tests. We aim to evaluate whether differences in returns are attributable to actual distinctions between groups or random fluctuations.

   **Data**  
   - **Finance_data**: Synthetic financial data generated for Independent T-Tests, comparing Group 1 and Group 2.
   - **Finance_data_2**: Synthetic financial data for Paired T-Test, comparing Group 3 and Group 4.

   **Methodology**  
   - **Independent T-Test (Equal & Unequal Variance)**: Tests if mean returns between customer groups are significantly different.
   - **Paired T-Test**: Examines paired group data to test for differences in mean returns.

   ## Key Steps
   1. **Data Generation**  
      - Synthetic financial data created for both independent and paired t-tests.
      - Data saved as Excel files for reproducibility and analysis.

   2. **Independent T-Tests**  
      - Performed two-sample t-tests assuming both equal and unequal variances.
      - Results presented with test statistics, p-values, and interpretations.

   3. **Paired T-Test**  
      - Paired t-test executed to assess mean return differences between paired groups.
      - Outcomes include test statistics, p-values, and result interpretations.

   ## Results Summary
   - **Independent T-Tests**: Significant differences found in mean returns between Groups 1 and 2.
   - **Paired T-Test**: Evidence of a notable difference in mean returns between paired groups (Groups 3 and 4).

   ## Conclusion
   The analysis concludes that mean returns among customer groups differ significantly across all test scenarios, providing statistical support for alternative hypotheses. This insight highlights variations in financial performance among analyzed groups.
